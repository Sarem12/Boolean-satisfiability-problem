<p>This research presents the Y Tree, a structured logical model designed to evaluate Boolean SAT (Satisfiability) problems efficiently. By utilizing a hierarchical combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates, the Y Tree ensures a systematic approach to SAT solving while maintaining scalability. This paper outlines the theoretical foundation, algorithmic representation, experimental analysis, and complexity considerations of the method.</p>

The study also explores the implications of Y Tree in the context of P vs NP, discussing its potential for solving SAT in polynomial time. The work is protected under copyright, and unauthorized use
